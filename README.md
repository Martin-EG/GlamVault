## What it is
**GlamVault** is an inventory platform where users can login and add their makeup items into their own digital inventory adding a custom “collection” for easy filtering/organize. **GlamVault** will also help users to track when their makeup will expire and save items to buy later in a wish list section.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
